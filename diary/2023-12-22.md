I was running into a bunch of issues today with vimwiki adding a .md to files that already had an extension (e.g. .csv) . This made it hard to link to other content within the wiki.

I eventually found [this commit](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/commit/c21c939b0630f5f453e85621cf611a5b86537511) tied to [this issue](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/issues/1256) describing the issue. I deleted this clause -- the three lines after line 266, and that is allowing me to do what I want. We'll almost certainly need to re-hack when I update vimwiki or more computers
