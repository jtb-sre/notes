I learned that SSSD has the ability to send more logs to syslog via an environment variable: `Environment=DEBUG_LOGGER=--logger=files`. Am not sure if the extra log volume is worth it yet

I spent a little bit of time today shopping for notebooks becuase it's kind of a bummer that it's only December and I'm already 15% of the way through my 2024 notebook that's supposed to start in January!

Originally, I went deep on the Kokuyo soft ring notebooks becuase I hated when rings get bent out of shape, but with the non-ring bindings that many A5 notebooks have I might have more luck. And many of those have much more than 50 sheets! There's even the Tomoe River S A52 that has 360 sheets of paper in an A5 format, but I'm not yet sure if I'll buy any of those.

Here's a link to them, just in case: https://www.jetpens.com/Sakae-TP-Tomoe-River-S-Hardcover-Notebook-A5-Grid-White/pd/38850
