# Personal notes
This is my logbook for personal note taking.

# Structure
* [Diary](./diary/diary.md): Per day logbook of notes, mostly from ephemeral investigations and similar
* [Career Notes](./career/README.md): Notes about current/previous jobs
* [Config Files](./conf): Reasonably portable config files
* [Scripts](./bin): scriptlets that can come with me
