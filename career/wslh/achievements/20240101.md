# The List!

## Troubleshoot Epic Storage to Allow Project to Proceed
* __When__: Early January
* __Why__: The Epic team had tooling that reported unusually poor storage performance for their production systems, causing them to feel uncomfortable about cutting overto the new VMs in production.
* __How__: Troubleshot the VMs in detail and wrote detailed summaries about findings. While we suspected quite early that it was due to the servers being idle, it was clear that the comfort level of Operations wasn't going to change without significant investigation. My detailed reports ruled out misconfigurations and provided them some tests that they could perform to increase their own confidence.
* __Result__: The ODBAs were able to cut over to the new VMs as they were originally configured.
